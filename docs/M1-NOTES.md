# Milestone 1 implementation notes

Running record of M1 decisions and deviations, in the spirit of `docs/M0-REVIEW.md`.
M1 began after the owner's explicit stop-point go-ahead (see `docs/M0-REVIEW.md`); Codex
retains independent verification and owns M1-605 plus the acceptance/contract suites
(T-901/903/904), which are authored blind against M1 code as it lands.

## M1-601 — Initial SQLite ledger migration + DB layer

The attribution ledger is the v1 source of truth (D16) and the tap-root of M1: this migration
gates M1-602/603/604, M1-406 and Codex's T-903 dry-run acceptance test.

Delivered:
- `src/whiskeyjack_bot/migrations/001_initial.sql` — the seven append-only ledger tables
  (`forecast_records`, `research_runs`, `research_documents`, `approval_events`,
  `submission_attempts`, `resolution_events`, `score_events`) plus a `schema_migrations`
  tracker. Constraints per `CODEX_HANDOFF.md` "Ledger design": `UNIQUE(question_id,
  tournament_id, forecast_version)`, `submission_attempts.idempotency_key UNIQUE`,
  `UNIQUE(retrieval_run_id, canonical_url, content_sha256)`, foreign keys between tables,
  and a `status` CHECK over the seven lifecycle states.
- `src/whiskeyjack_bot/ledger.py` — `connect()` (WAL, `foreign_keys=ON`, `busy_timeout`,
  autocommit + explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`) and idempotent `initialize_ledger()` that applies
  unrecorded migrations and tracks each by version + sha256 checksum. `LedgerError` follows the
  `ConfigError`/`SnapshotError` hygiene rule (never echo stored values; `from None`).
- `tests/unit/test_ledger.py` — 10 tests: table set, WAL/FK pragmas, each unique constraint,
  FK enforcement, `status` CHECK, deterministic + idempotent re-run, and a no-leak `LedgerError`
  path. Suite: 96 passed; ruff check + format + `mypy --strict src` clean.

Deviation — **migrations live inside the package** (`whiskeyjack_bot.migrations`) rather than at
the repo root shown in the handoff's *proposed* tree. Rationale: they then ship in the wheel and
load via `importlib.resources` regardless of install layout; `hatchling` already packages
`src/whiskeyjack_bot`, so the subdir is included with no config change. No new runtime dependency
(`sqlite3` is stdlib) — `uv.lock` is untouched and the locked-sync CI step stays green.

Deferred (do not read the absence as an omission):
- The append-only **enforcement mechanism** (UPDATE/DELETE-blocking triggers on the event tables)
  and how `forecast_records.status` transitions relate to immutability land with **M1-602/M1-603**,
  where the write paths are built.
- `record_id` generation (UUIDv7/ULID) belongs with the first writer (**M1-602**); no ID minting
  in this DB-layer-only slice.
