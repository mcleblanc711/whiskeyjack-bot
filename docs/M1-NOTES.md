# Milestone 1 implementation notes

Running record of M1 decisions and deviations, in the spirit of `docs/M0-REVIEW.md`.
M1 began after the owner's explicit stop-point go-ahead (see `docs/M0-REVIEW.md`); Codex
retains independent verification and owns M1-605 plus the acceptance/contract suites
(T-901/903/904), which are authored blind against M1 code as it lands.

## M1-601 — Initial SQLite ledger migration + DB layer

The attribution ledger is the v1 source of truth (D16) and the tap-root of M1: this migration
gates M1-602/603/604, M1-406 and Codex's T-903 dry-run acceptance test.

Delivered:
- `src/whiskeyjack_bot/migrations/001_initial.sql` — the seven append-only ledger tables
  (`forecast_records`, `research_runs`, `research_documents`, `approval_events`,
  `submission_attempts`, `resolution_events`, `score_events`) plus a `schema_migrations`
  tracker. Constraints per `CODEX_HANDOFF.md` "Ledger design": `UNIQUE(question_id,
  tournament_id, forecast_version)`, `submission_attempts.idempotency_key UNIQUE`,
  `UNIQUE(retrieval_run_id, canonical_url, content_sha256)`, foreign keys between tables,
  and a `status` CHECK over the seven lifecycle states.
- `src/whiskeyjack_bot/ledger.py` — `connect()` (WAL, `foreign_keys=ON`, `busy_timeout`,
  autocommit + explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`) and idempotent `initialize_ledger()` that applies
  unrecorded migrations and tracks each by version + sha256 checksum. `LedgerError` follows the
  `ConfigError`/`SnapshotError` hygiene rule (never echo stored values; `from None`).
- `tests/unit/test_ledger.py` — 10 tests: table set, WAL/FK pragmas, each unique constraint,
  FK enforcement, `status` CHECK, deterministic + idempotent re-run, and a no-leak `LedgerError`
  path. Suite: 96 passed; ruff check + format + `mypy --strict src` clean.

Deviation — **migrations live inside the package** (`whiskeyjack_bot.migrations`) rather than at
the repo root shown in the handoff's *proposed* tree. Rationale: they then ship in the wheel and
load via `importlib.resources` regardless of install layout; `hatchling` already packages
`src/whiskeyjack_bot`, so the subdir is included with no config change. No new runtime dependency
(`sqlite3` is stdlib) — `uv.lock` is untouched and the locked-sync CI step stays green.

Deferred (do not read the absence as an omission):
- The append-only **enforcement mechanism** (UPDATE/DELETE-blocking triggers on the event tables)
  and how `forecast_records.status` transitions relate to immutability land with **M1-602/M1-603**,
  where the write paths are built.
- `record_id` generation (UUIDv7/ULID) belongs with the first writer (**M1-602**); no ID minting
  in this DB-layer-only slice.

## M1-201 — Canonical question model

Questions have so far flowed through the pipeline as the pinned SDK's own Pydantic models
(`forecasting_tools.data_models.questions`), which track the package and can shift under us.
M1-201 introduces the **stable internal schema** the rest of M1 depends on instead, so an SDK bump
cannot ripple through retrieval, forecast generation, validation and the ledger writers. It gates
M1-202/M1-203 and Codex's T-901.

Delivered:
- `src/whiskeyjack_bot/questions/model.py` — strict Pydantic models (reusing `config._StrictModel`,
  `extra="forbid"`) as a `qtype`-discriminated union: `CanonicalBinaryQuestion`,
  `CanonicalMultipleChoiceQuestion`, `CanonicalNumericQuestion`, plus the `CanonicalQuestion` union
  alias and a `CanonicalQuestionAdapter` for validating raw dicts. Common fields carry
  `resolution_criteria` + `fine_print` (the M1-201 retention target) and the group-parent identity
  (`group_question_option`, `question_ids_of_group`) that M1-202 needs.
- `src/whiskeyjack_bot/questions/normalize.py` — `normalize_question()` / `normalize_questions()`,
  the single place SDK field names are read. `NormalizationError` follows the
  `ConfigError`/`SnapshotError`/`LedgerError` hygiene rule (inputs stripped via
  `errors(include_input=False)`; `from None`).
- `tests/unit/test_questions.py` — 34 tests: per-type mapping, fine-print retention against the raw
  fixtures, MC options, numeric bounds/cdf, group-identity carry-through, union round-trip,
  malformed-record table, and no-leak planted-secret paths. Suite: 138 passed; ruff check +
  format + `mypy --strict src` clean. (GPT review round 1 raised this to 69 module tests /
  173 suite — see the round-1 section below.)

Hardening — a question object missing the fields its declared type requires is reported as a
`NormalizationError`, not a raw `AttributeError`/`TypeError`. This is the same defect class as the
M0-103 review finding against `SnapshotError` (callers only handle the module's own error type),
so it is pinned by a test here rather than left for review to rediscover.

Decision — **dispatch keys on the SDK's `question_type` literal, not `isinstance`.** The SDK's
`DiscreteQuestion` *subclasses* `NumericQuestion`, so an `isinstance(q, NumericQuestion)` test would
silently normalize the unsupported `discrete` type as numeric. `_SUPPORTED_TYPES` is derived from
`config.SupportedQuestionType` via `get_args`, so D20's type list stays single-sourced. A regression
test pins this (`test_discrete_question_is_rejected_despite_subclassing_numeric`).

Deviation — placed in a **`questions/` subpackage** mirroring `metaculus/`, rather than the flat
`schemas.py` + `normalize.py` in the handoff's proposed tree, since M1-202/M1-203 add type-specific
logic to the same area.

Deferred (do not read the absence as an omission):
- Unsupported types raise `UnsupportedQuestionTypeError` (before any field is read, so zero
  model/submission calls). Turning that refusal into a **logged diagnostic event** is **M1-203**.
- Group **unpacking** is **M1-202**; M1-201 only carries the parent linkage through unchanged.
- The comprehensive valid/invalid **golden fixture set is Codex's T-901**, authored blind; this
  slice ships only the tests that prove its own model and mapping.
- `cdf_size` is stored as a plain int. Enforcing the 201-point count (`config.expected_cdf_points`)
  is calibration-time validation, i.e. **M1-503**.

### M1-201 — GPT review round 1

All four mechanical findings reproduced against the pinned SDK and were fixed:

- **Tag handling** (`normalize.py`). Two defects in one expression. An unhashable
  `question_type` (a list) raised a raw `TypeError` out of the `in _SUPPORTED_TYPES` test,
  escaping the module's error boundary entirely — `isinstance` is now tested first. And an
  arbitrary string tag was echoed verbatim, so the tag is now named only when it is a member
  of `_KNOWN_SDK_TYPES` (derived from the SDK's own `QuestionBasicType`); anything else
  renders as `'unknown'`. The docstring claim that the tag "is a fixed SDK enum value" is now
  enforced rather than assumed.
- **Finite floats** (`model.py`). Pydantic accepts NaN/±inf for a bare `float`; NaN also slips
  past `_bounds_ordered` because both ordering comparisons are false. `model_dump_json` then
  writes `null` and the union adapter cannot read the record back — so the round-trip the
  module advertises was conditionally false. All canonical floats now use
  `_Finite = Annotated[float, Field(allow_inf_nan=False)]`.
- **Option-set integrity** (`model.py`). `["A","A",""]` and `["A"]` both validated under the
  old `min_length=1`. M1-404 must emit "every exact option once with probabilities summing to
  one", which is unrepresentable when duplicate labels collapse as mapping keys — so the
  constraint belongs at the input contract, not downstream. Now `min_length=2` plus a
  validator rejecting blank and duplicate labels (without echoing them).
- **Catch boundary** (`normalize.py`). One `try` spanned both SDK field reads and canonical
  model construction, so a future internal `TypeError` in construction would have been
  reported as a malformed input record. Field reads are now fenced separately; construction
  errors stay visible.

Decision — **`source_categories` carries the SDK's `categories` slugs through uninterpreted.**
The review asked for a source-backed *domain* field. No SDK question class has one: the only
domain-shaped field is `categories: list[Category]`, and this project's domain taxonomy lives
in `config/x_accounts.yaml` (`econ_data`, `space_launch`, …) with no mechanical mapping from
Metaculus categories. No backlog item assigns a domain to a *question*; the only spec text is
one bullet in the downstream **forecast record** list (`CODEX_HANDOFF.md`), owned by M1-602.
The recoverable half of the concern is real, though — `normalize.py` is the single place SDK
fields are read, so a field dropped there cannot be recovered downstream without a re-fetch.
Hence the passthrough, named `source_*` so it is not mistaken for the project's domain tag.
Deriving an actual domain tag remains **M1-307 / M1-602**.

All three repo fixtures carry an empty category list, so the passthrough is pinned by
synthetic-object tests rather than fixture assertions — a fixture-driven check would have
passed against a hardcoded `[]`. The same vacuity affected the group-linkage test the review
flagged (every fixture has a null group parent); it now uses non-null synthetic linkage.
