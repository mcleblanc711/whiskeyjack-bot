# Milestone 1 — Question Normalization epic (M1-20x) implementation notes

Running record of M1-20x decisions and deviations, in the spirit of `docs/M0-REVIEW.md`
and `docs/M1-NOTES.md`.

**This file is temporary and merges back into `docs/M1-NOTES.md`.** It is split out because
M1 is being built across parallel worktrees (one branch per backlog item), and
`docs/M1-NOTES.md` is the one file every branch would otherwise append to — guaranteeing a
textual merge conflict on every merge.

**Merge-back trigger:** when the Question Normalization epic (M1-201 through M1-203) is
complete and merged to master, append these sections to `docs/M1-NOTES.md` in issue order
and delete this file. Do it as a single docs-only commit, after the last M1-20x merge.
Note that **M1-201 predates this convention** and already appended directly to
`docs/M1-NOTES.md`; only M1-202 onward live here.

## M1-202 — Group-question unpacking

Acceptance: *unpacked fixtures produce one unique internal question per subquestion and no
duplicate IDs.*

### What the criterion is actually guarding against

Group questions arrive as a single *post* carrying a `group_of_questions` block.
`group_of_questions` is a post-level tag, never a `question_type`, so there is no
`GroupQuestion` model in the pinned SDK and expansion is purely a fetch-time concern.

Expansion — ours and the SDK's alike — deep-copies the **parent post** once per subquestion
and swaps in that subquestion's block. Verified against `forecasting-tools==0.2.92`
(`helpers/metaculus_client.py:682-700`), every sibling therefore shares:

| field | across siblings |
|---|---|
| `question_id` | **unique** |
| `post_id`, `url` | identical (the URL is built from the post id) |
| `fine_print`, `background_info`, `resolution_criteria` | identical — the parent's, overwriting each subquestion's own |
| `question_ids_of_group` | identical (full sibling list) |
| `group_question_option` | unique (the subquestion's label) |

So **any identity keyed on `post_id` or `url` collapses an entire group to one record.**
That is the failure the acceptance criterion is written against, and
`test_siblings_share_the_post_but_not_the_question_id` pins it explicitly so a future
refactor cannot reintroduce it quietly.

Decision: **`question_id` is the internal identity anchor.** It agrees with the ledger's
existing `UNIQUE (question_id, tournament_id, forecast_version)`
(`migrations/001_initial.sql:40`), so no migration and no schema change were needed —
canonical questions are not persisted yet, and there is no questions table.

### Delivered

- `src/whiskeyjack_bot/questions/groups.py` — `unpack_group_post()` and `is_group_post()`.
  Our own expansion, mirroring the SDK's semantics.
- `src/whiskeyjack_bot/questions/model.py` — one new canonical field, `group_parent_title`.
- `src/whiskeyjack_bot/questions/normalize.py` — `_group_parent_title()` recovery, and
  batch-level duplicate-`question_id` enforcement in `normalize_questions()`.
- `tests/fixtures/api_posts/group/minibench_group.json` — the repo's first group fixture.
- `tests/unit/test_groups.py` — 22 tests. Suite 301 → 323.

### Decision — we own the expansion rather than calling the SDK's

The SDK's expansion is reachable only as `MetaculusClient._unpack_group_question`, a private
static method on a network-bound client class. Binding to a `_`-prefixed API is not a
contract, and it is what makes a raw group post exercisable as an offline fixture.

The cost is ~20 duplicated lines that can drift on an SDK bump. Mitigated by
`test_our_unpacking_matches_the_pinned_sdk`, which compares our output to the SDK's
field-by-field on the same fixture. It is a **drift alarm, not a guarantee** — it proves the
two agree on this fixture, not on all inputs.

Excluded from that comparison: `date_accessed` (set at construction, so two expansions
legitimately differ) and `api_json` (the raw post echoed back verbatim by both — comparing it
adds nothing and would dominate the diff on failure).

### Decision — `group_parent_title`, and why only the title

Expansion sets each subquestion's `question_text` from the **subquestion** block
(`questions.py:171`) and discards the parent post's title entirely. Metaculus titles some
subquestions with only their option label, so a subquestion can reach the forecaster as the
bare string `"September 2026"` — which states no question at all.

The parent title survives on `api_json`, the raw post payload the SDK retains, and is lifted
back out into a canonical `group_parent_title`.

**Only the title is lifted; `api_json` itself is never carried onto the canonical model.**
The payload contains the community-prediction `aggregations`, and the canonical question is
the forecaster's input boundary — *community prediction is never a forecaster input in v1*
is a hard constraint, and carrying the payload would breach it by accident.

`group_parent_title` degrades to `None` rather than raising when the payload is absent (a
question rebuilt from a snapshot has no obligation to carry one) or blank. The fixture
deliberately contains a label-only subquestion title so
`test_group_parent_title_is_load_bearing_not_decorative` fails if the field ever stops doing
real work — the vacuity failure mode M1-201 hit three times.

### Decision — duplicate IDs are refused at the boundary

`normalize_questions()` now enforces `question_id` uniqueness across the batch. A duplicate
would otherwise collide on the ledger's unique constraint — but only *after* a forecast had
been generated and paid for. The error reports the **count only**, not the colliding ids:
an id is low-risk content, but the no-echo rule is unconditional and the softer reading of it
has been a review finding before.

### Deviation from the SDK — tolerant parent overrides

The SDK indexes `group_json["fine_print"]`, `["description"]` and `["resolution_criteria"]`
directly, raising `KeyError` when a group block omits one. `unpack_group_post` overrides only
the keys actually **present**.

The tolerance is scoped to **absent** keys only. A key the parent carries explicitly as
`null` still overwrites the subquestion's own value with `None` — matching the SDK, and
intended: an explicit null is the parent stating the field is empty for the whole group,
which is not the same as the parent not addressing it at all. Pinned by
`test_explicit_parent_null_overrides_subquestion_value`.

(An earlier draft of this note claimed the deviation "never erases a subquestion's own value
by replacing it with `None`". That was too strong and was corrected after review.)

On a well-formed post the two implementations are identical, which is what the drift test
compares.

### Deferred (do not read the absence as an omission)

- **Type policy stays in `normalize`, not `groups`.** A well-formed `date` subquestion
  expands without complaint and is refused downstream by `normalize_question` (D21), so the
  reason reported is the real one rather than "malformed group". Pinned by
  `test_deferred_subquestion_types_are_refused_by_normalize_not_unpack`.
- **A deferred subquestion still aborts the whole batch**, because `normalize_questions`
  propagates the first failure. Turning that into a per-question skip with a logged
  diagnostic event is **M1-203**, which owns the diagnostic path.
- **Nothing calls `unpack_group_post` in the pipeline yet.** On the live path the SDK
  already expands groups inside `get_all_open_questions_from_tournament`
  (`metaculus/fetch.py:85`, `group_question_mode` default `"unpack_subquestions"`), so
  `normalize_question` receives subquestions already separated. Our seam exists for offline
  fixtures and for any future path that reads raw post JSON.
- The comprehensive valid/invalid **golden fixture set is Codex's T-901**; this slice ships
  only the group fixture its own acceptance needs.

### Standing risk — not verifiable offline

Whether real MiniBench group subquestion titles are already self-describing cannot be checked
without live data. `group_parent_title` is the **stricter reading** (brief rule 4): it costs
one nullable field and removes a class of unforecastable prompt input. If live data shows
subquestion titles are always full questions, the field becomes redundant but not wrong.

Same class as M1-201's standing risk about one-option multiple-choice questions.

### Fixture note

`tests/fixtures/api_posts/group/minibench_group.json` sits in a **subdirectory**. The existing
loader `load_fixture_questions()` (`tests/unit/test_questions.py`) globs `api_posts/*_post.json`
non-recursively and feeds each straight to `DataOrganizer.get_question_from_post_json`, which
asserts `"question" in post_json` and knows nothing about groups. A group post placed under
that glob would break **every** existing question test.

Per M1-201's review history, the fixture varies its subquestion ids, timestamps and question
weights rather than reusing shared constants — shared-constant vacuity was a repeat finding
there, and this fixture's entire purpose is that siblings differ.
